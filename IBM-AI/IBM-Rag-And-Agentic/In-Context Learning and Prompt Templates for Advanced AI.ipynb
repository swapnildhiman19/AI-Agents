        "Congratulations on completing this lab on prompt engineering and LangChain prompt templates! You've successfully navigated from basic prompting techniques to more advanced approaches including zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot learning, as well as chain-of-thought reasoning and self-consistency prompting. You then applied these concepts practically using LangChain's prompt templates with the modern LCEL pattern to create various applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "By learning how to properly structure prompts and build composable chains with the pipe operator (`|`), you've gained essential skills for developing robust LLM applications. These techniques provide a solid foundation for creating more complex systems and getting the most out of any language model you work with.\n"
