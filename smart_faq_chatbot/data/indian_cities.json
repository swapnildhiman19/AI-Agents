Old Delhi’s labyrinthine lanes open into Mughal masterpieces like the Red Fort and the Jama Masjid, while leafy New Delhi showcases Lutyens’ grand avenues, India Gate, and the Parliament complex. The city straddles the Yamuna River and hums with markets such as Chandni Chowk and Dilli Haat, where aromas of chaat, kebabs, and parathas mingle with the clang of cycle‑rickshaws.\n\nCenturies of rule—from the Delhi Sultanate to the Mughals and the British Raj—left a dense constellation of monuments: Humayun’s Tomb foreshadowed the Taj’s design; Qutub Minar rises from the remains of earlier settlements. Urban villages like Hauz Khas and Shahpur Jat repurpose medieval reservoirs and ruins into creative hubs. Museums, crafts enclaves, and Sufi shrines like Nizamuddin Auliya keep living traditions in view.\n\nDespite traffic and extreme summers, Delhi sustains surprising biodiversity in the Aravalli ridge parks and the Yamuna floodplains. Nilgai sometimes wander the city’s edges; winter brings migratory birds to wetlands like Okhla. Festivals—Diwali, Eid, Holi, Gurpurab—paint the city in lights, colors, and devotional music. Street food culture, classical arts at auditoriums, and a thriving café scene round out a metropolis that is equal parts archive and accelerator.",
